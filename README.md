# LSTM Time Series Prediction
LSTM using Keras to predict the international airline passengers. There are two running files. passengers_lstm.py is predicting the international airline passengers without using stateful and lstm_stateful.py is using stateful to check if stateful helps the prediction of time series data.

## Requirements
Please check the version of libraries I used for this LSTM.

- pandas==0.23.3
- numpy==1.15.4
- tensorflow==1.12.0
- keras==2.2.4
- matplotlib==3.0.2
