# LSTM Time Series Prediction
LSTM using Keras to predict the time series data. There are two running files to predict nternational airline passengers. passengers_lstm.py is predicting without using stateful and lstm_stateful.py is using stateful and check if stateful helps the prediction for the time series data. We use 70% of data to train the LSTM model and predict the exactly the same length of other 30% of data and check the accuracy by comparing with other 30% of data.

## Requirements
Please check the version of libraries I used for this LSTM.

- pandas==0.23.3
- numpy==1.15.4
- tensorflow==1.12.0
- keras==2.2.4
- matplotlib==3.0.2
